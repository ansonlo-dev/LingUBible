# Overview
The grade distribution chart in LingUBible experiences a constant refreshing/flickering issue when viewed on mobile devices in landscape orientation. This creates a poor user experience with the chart continuously re-rendering, making it difficult for users to interact with the visualization and causing performance issues.

# Core Features
## Bug Fix: Mobile Landscape Chart Stability
- **What it does**: Prevents the grade distribution chart from continuously refreshing when mobile devices are in landscape orientation
- **Why it's important**: Users cannot properly view or interact with grade distribution data on mobile landscape, leading to frustration and potential data misinterpretation
- **How it works at a high level**: 
  - Debounce resize events to prevent rapid re-renders
  - Optimize chart re-initialization logic
  - Implement proper mobile detection for orientation changes
  - Cache chart state to avoid unnecessary recomputation

## Chart Performance Optimization
- **What it does**: Improves overall chart rendering performance on mobile devices
- **Why it's important**: Mobile devices have limited resources and the current implementation causes excessive CPU usage
- **How it works at a high level**:
  - Reduce animation overhead on mobile
  - Implement virtual rendering for large datasets
  - Optimize tooltip handling for touch devices
  - Minimize DOM manipulations during orientation changes

# User Experience
## User Personas
- **Mobile Students**: Primary users accessing course reviews on smartphones/tablets between classes
- **Landscape Viewers**: Users who prefer landscape orientation for better data visualization
- **Data Analysts**: Users comparing multiple instructors/courses needing stable charts

## Key User Flows
1. User rotates device from portrait to landscape
2. Chart should smoothly transition without flickering
3. User can interact with chart (tap bars, view tooltips)
4. Chart remains stable during scrolling and touch gestures

## UI/UX Considerations
- Maintain visual consistency across orientations
- Ensure touch targets remain accessible
- Preserve user selections/filters during orientation changes
- Provide smooth transitions without jarring refreshes

# Technical Architecture
## System Components
- **GradeDistributionChart Component**: Main React component handling chart rendering
- **ECharts Library**: Underlying charting library requiring optimization
- **Resize Event Handlers**: Current implementation causing infinite loops
- **Mobile Detection Logic**: Needs improvement for orientation handling

## Data Models
- Chart configuration state (options, theme, dimensions)
- Filter selections (instructor/course filters)
- Chart type state (bar, stacked, boxplot)
- Mobile/orientation state tracking

## APIs and Integrations
- ECharts API for chart rendering
- React hooks for state management
- Window resize/orientation change events
- Touch event handling for mobile interactions

## Infrastructure Requirements
- Client-side performance monitoring
- Error tracking for chart rendering issues
- Mobile device testing across various screen sizes
- Performance profiling tools

3. **Event Handler Optimization**
   - Depends on mobile detection
   - Implement proper debouncing
   - Add event cleanup

4. **State Management**
   - Requires optimized event handlers
   - Cache chart configurations
   - Preserve user selections

5. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Built on stable implementation
   - Track render times
   - Identify remaining bottlenecks

6. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Final layer after stability achieved
   - Add smooth transitions
   - Implement advanced interactions

# Risks and Mitigations
## Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: ECharts library limitations for mobile
- **Mitigation**: Implement wrapper logic to control chart lifecycle, consider alternative libraries if needed

- **Risk**: Browser compatibility issues across mobile devices
- **Mitigation**: Extensive testing on various devices, implement fallbacks

- **Risk**: Performance degradation with complex visualizations
- **Mitigation**: Implement progressive enhancement, simpler mobile layouts

## Figuring out the MVP
- **Risk**: Over-engineering the solution
- **Mitigation**: Start with minimal fix to stop refresh loop, iterate based on user feedback

- **Risk**: Breaking existing desktop functionality
- **Mitigation**: Implement mobile-specific code paths, extensive regression testing

## Resource Constraints
- **Risk**: Limited mobile testing devices
- **Mitigation**: Use browser dev tools, cloud testing services, user beta testing

- **Risk**: Time constraints for comprehensive fix
- **Mitigation**: Phased approach with quick wins first
